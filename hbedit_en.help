   Hbedit - multi-mode editor, the current mode is displayed in the right
corner of a status bar. The default mode is "Edit", in this mode you work
as in a common text editor, using arrows, Home / End, Page Up / Page Down
to move through the text, with the mouse to set the cursor in desired position.
   The editor's menu is invoked in this mode by pressing the F9 key or
clicking the mouse on "F9-menu" in the status bar. The menu shows hotkeys for
relevant functions, so you can use it as a reference.

   There are a total of 4 modes in Hbedit: Edit (Edit), Select (Sele),
Vim-like (Vim) and command (Cmd).

   The selection mode is activated at the beginning of the text selection. You may
highlight text:
1) as usual, the arrow keys with the Shift key pressed;
2) as in Midnight Commander, pressing F3 and then continue the selection using
   cursor movements keys and keys used in Vim (h, j, k, l, w, W, e, E, b, B, G, 0, ^, $);
3) Ctrl-A selects all text.

   Selecting the desired text, you can use the following hotkeys:

   Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Ins, y put text into the system buffer;
   F3                put text into one of 10 internal buffers (0th is system);
   Del, d            delete the text;
   Shift-Del,Ctrl-X  put in the system buffer and delete;
   c                 delete the text and switching to edit mode;
   r[x]              replace all chars in selected text with x;
   u, U              convert, respectively, to lower or upper case;
   >, <              increase / decrease indent;
   .                 repeat the last operation with a selected region;
   m, F9             menu for a selected region;
   o                 continue selection from opposite end;
   i[w,W]            select a word under the cursor;
   i[",']            select a text between quotes (double or single);
   i[b,(,)]          select a text in parentheses;
   i[                select a text in square brackets;
   i[{,}]            select a text in braces;
   ESC               cancel selection.

   After pressing y, F3, Del, d, Shift-Del you return to
editing. You can paste text from the buffer, as usual, with the keys Ctrl-V, Shift-Ins.
At the same time, if you saved something in buffers from 1 to 9, a list of buffers will appear,
to choose from which to insert. If only the system was used, everything will be as usual.

Vim keys (i, a, ...).
